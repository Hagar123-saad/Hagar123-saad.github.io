    <h3><i>Hello, I am Hagar Abdellatif, a student at CSI college studying computer science. I am in my third year at college.</i></h3>

    <p>
        Since I was young, I have always loved computers and spent a lot of time on them. I did not know anything about this field, but I entered it based on my passion for computers.
        I find this field very interesting. I studied C++ and am still studying it. In fact, I have not found myself in any specific field in computer science yet.
        However, I feel attracted to the web field, so I took this class.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also love everything related to montage, photo, and video editing. I designed a logo for an Egyptian brand and find myself enjoying anything involving photos and editing.
        So, I chose the web field to explore if my passion lies here or not.
